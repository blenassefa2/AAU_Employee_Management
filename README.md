## Employee Management Portal
This project is an Employee Management Portal that provides a comprehensive solution for managing employee-related tasks and processes. It consists of a web front-end developed using React, a mobile front-end built with React Native, and a back-end powered by Node.js. The web front-end is deployed on Vercel at https://final-project-nine-pi.vercel.app/, while the back-end was temporarily deployed on Railway.
## Features and Functionality

- Leave Request Management: Employees can submit leave requests through the portal, and HR managers can review and approve or reject them.
- Bi-Annual Evaluation: The system facilitates the bi-annual evaluation process, allowing employees to provide self-assessments and managers to conduct performance evaluations.
- Performance Evaluation History: The portal keeps a record of past performance evaluations, enabling employees and HR managers to access and review them.
- Employee Information Management: The system enables the management of employee information, including personal details, contact information, and job-related data.
- Task Tracking and Assignment: HR managers can assign tasks to employees and track the progress of assigned tasks.
- Notifications and Reminders: The portal sends notifications and reminders to employees and HR managers for pending tasks, upcoming evaluations, and other important events.
